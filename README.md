## Contributions

Any help solving unsolved tasks or proposing new and better solutions is more than welcome.

I'm currently only working on the `Javascript` version of the solutions as I'm learning the language, If anyone is interested in providing solutions in others languages such as `C++`,`Java`,`C#`,`Pyton`,`PHP`or `Ruby` feel free to make a pull request.

## Spread the word

Also feel free to fork and create your own repo, star this project for more updates as I push new solutions every now and then.

**Cheers**
